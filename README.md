# About

Experiment to host music in github.

# Reason

Github is a cool place to store your work. But it's mostly for software, what about other creative work?

Github have higher visibility than your random "free public domain / creative commons sharing site" (except YouTube). 

Github have clear licensing html widget (showing license name and it's icon, when clicked it will show license summary) when you add `LICENSE` file.

# Try inputting HTML

<div>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="HoldOnASec.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
  <button>Click me!</button>
  <h3>h3</h3>
<div>
